        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Aptakisic Junior High School is a Very Good School, with good teachers and kind students. The entire school campus is very beautiful and natural! Everyone is Welcome to Learn at Aptakisic Junior High School.

Every day, every student will come to school and be met with learning opportunities at his or her personal developmental level in all subject areas. He or she will leave school having been challenged, feeling successful, and looking forward to tomorrow.
            
            District 102 uses three areas or connected components as a framework to create the conditions for our students to develop the competencies outlined in our Portrait of a Graduate. <br><br> Read more about our interrelated components: Modern Instructional Design, Inclusive Practices, and Communication for Partnership and Engagement. Belonging to our school community, building relationships, and making connections are equally important in creating an optimal learning environment, as well as an integral by-product of our learning process.

            The Portrait of a D102 Graduate represents our aspirations or vision for every student and inspires us to create the conditions which have the greatest potential to develop and nurture the competencies and sustainable life skills outlined in our Portrait of a Graduate.

            We are very proud of Every Student, and Their Achievments they've made here at Aptakisic.</p>
